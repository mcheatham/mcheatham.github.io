        This job began as a continuation of the type of web programming work I
        had done at Bank of America. I wrote portlets that performed a variety
        of business-related tasks, such as inventory tracking. After the first
        year, my work shifted from web programming to basic research. I
        currently evaluate research proposals, manage contractors doing R&D
        tasks, and work on individual projects.  I have spent much of my free
        time at work during the last year becoming more proficient in network
        security, software reverse engineering techniques, and secure software
        development.

        At Bank of America I worked together with four team members to enhance
        content and personalization features on the company's consumer portal
        website. Through this work I learned many of the basic web programming
        technologies, including DHTML, CSS, XML, XSL, JavaScript, Java Server
        Pages, and servlets. I also wrote schema and SQL queries for some of
        the Oracle database tables underlying the site. In addition, I gained a
        working knowledge of the J2EE architecture.

        While still an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant to
        develop a Java graphical user interface that allowed the user to
        interact with an experimental system designed to test FPGAs
        (programmable logic chips) for defects.

    - employer: National Security Agency
      title: Computer Science Co-op
      start-date: 1997
      end-date: 1999
      id: nsa
      details: >
        During the course of my three co-op tours at the National Security
        Agency, I worked in two different offices. In the first office, I was
        part of a five-person development team. My job primarily involved
        reviewing requirements, UML diagrams, and use cases and writing C++
        code to meet those specifications. While the work was very rudimentary,
        this was my first real programming job, and I learned a great deal.

        In the second office, I worked alone from a set of requirements to
        develop a Java graphical user interface to allow remote manipulation of
        an oscilloscope. Because this work involved aspects of Java that I had
        not used before and required me to learn the native language of the
        oscilloscope, it gave me the opportunity to learn how to work
        independently and pour through documentation and examples to solve
        problems that I had not been formally taught how to handle in school.
