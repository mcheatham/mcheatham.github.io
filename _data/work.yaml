    This job began as a continuation of the type of web programming work I
    had done at Bank of America. I wrote portlets that performed a variety
    of business-related tasks, such as inventory tracking. After the first
    year, my work shifted from web programming to basic research. I
    currently evaluate research proposals, manage contractors doing R&D
    tasks, and work on individual projects.  I have spent much of my free
    time at work during the last year becoming more proficient in network
    security, software reverse engineering techniques, and secure software
    development.

    At Bank of America I worked together with four team members to enhance
    content and personalization features on the company's consumer portal
    website. Through this work I learned many of the basic web programming
    technologies, including DHTML, CSS, XML, XSL, JavaScript, Java Server
    Pages, and servlets. I also wrote schema and SQL queries for some of
    the Oracle database tables underlying the site. In addition, I gained a
    working knowledge of the J2EE architecture.

    While still an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant to
    develop a Java graphical user interface that allowed the user to
    interact with an experimental system designed to test FPGAs
    (programmable logic chips) for defects.

    During the course of my three co-op tours at the National Security
    Agency, I worked in two different offices. In the first office, I was
    part of a five-person development team. My job primarily involved
    reviewing requirements, UML diagrams, and use cases and writing C++
    code to meet those specifications. While the work was very rudimentary,
    this was my first real programming job, and I learned a great deal.

    In the second office, I worked alone from a set of requirements to
    develop a Java graphical user interface to allow remote manipulation of
    an oscilloscope. Because this work involved aspects of Java that I had
    not used before and required me to learn the native language of the
    oscilloscope, it gave me the opportunity to learn how to work
    independently and pour through documentation and examples to solve
    problems that I had not been formally taught how to handle in school.
