Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Michelle</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Cheatham</span></span>. I currently work as an <span itemprop="jobTitle">Assistant Professor</span> (teaching stream) in the Computer Science Department at the <span itemprop="worksFor" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://www.ucalgary.ca"><span itemprop="name">University of Calgary</span></a></span> in Alberta, Canada, where I also serve as the Director of the <a itemprop="url" href="https://grad.ucalgary.ca/future-students/explore-programs/information-security-and-privacy-misp-course">Information Security and Privacy professional master's program</a>. I am here on a closed work permit until August 2027 and have applied for permanent residency.

I was previously a tenured Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. My research centered on Semantic Web topics such as developing ontology design patterns and automated ontology alignment. I also have experience with topics related to cybersecurity, such as binary analysis, reverse engineering, and software vulnerability assessment, which I developed expertise in while working for the <a href="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/">Air Force Research Lab</a>. Lately I have been concentrating largely on pedagogy. Because of this, I am not accepting any graduate students at this time.

I've had a somewhat winding career path, in that I worked as a civil servant
at the Air Force Research Lab for quite awhile before going back to school. After seven
years of government employment, TPS reports got the better of me. I quit my cushy government job and tried out various other places of employment. Eventually I landed at Wright State
University, and it was a great fit. Being an academic is fantastic &mdash;
I get the opportunity to meet tons of fascinating people and talk about
interesting ideas with them. However, the mass shootings in the US shook me,
which prompted my move to the University of Calgary in 2023. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy watching sports and trying out new craft 
beers with my husband <span itemprop="spouse" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Jason</span></span></span>. I'm also learning to ice skate.

I can be reached at <span itemprop="email">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</span>
