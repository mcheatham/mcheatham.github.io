Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Michelle</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Cheatham</span></span>. I currently work as an <span itemprop="jobTitle">Assistant Professor</span> in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at <span itemprop="worksFor" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://www.wright.edu"><span itemprop="name">Wright State University</span></a></span> in <span itemprop="workLocation" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"><a itemprop="url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio"><span itemprop="name">Dayton, Ohio</span></a></span>.

My research has centered on Semantic Web topics such as developing ontology design patterns and automated ontology alignment. I also have experience with topics related to cybersecurity, such as binary analysis, reverse engineering, and software vulnerability assessment, which I developed expertise in while working for the <a href="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/">Air Force Research Lab</a>. Lately I have been concentrating largely on pedagogy, and I am currently the course coordinator of the introductory programming course sequence at Wright State.

I've had a somewhat winding career path, in that I worked as a civil servant
at the Air Force Research Lab for quite awhile before going back to school. After seven
years of government employment, TPS
reports got the better of me. I quit my cushy government job and tried out
various other places of employment. Eventually I landed at Wright State
University, and it has been a great fit. Being an academic is fantastic &mdash;
I get the opportunity to meet tons of fascinating people and talk about
interesting ideas with them.

When I'm not working, I enjoy trying out new craft
beers with my husband <span itemprop="spouse" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Jason</span></span></span> or teaching my dog Shiloh new tricks (like "don't
eat the cat").

I can be reached at <span itemprop="email">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</span>
