Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Michelle</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Cheatham</span></span>. I recently finished up a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, and now I have joined the faculty at <span itemprop="worksFor" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://www.wright.edu"><span itemprop="name">Wright State University</span></a></span> in <span itemprop="workLocation" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"><a itemprop="url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio"><span itemprop="name">Dayton, Ohio</span></a></span> as an <span itemprop="jobTitle">Assistant Professor</span>. As a faculty member, I plan to continue my work on Semantic Web topics as well as pursue research topics related to cybersecurity, which I developed expertise in while working for the <a href="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/">Air Force Research Lab</a>. I will both co-lead the <span itemprop="memberOf" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/daselab.html"><span itemprop="name">Data Semantics (DaSe) Lab</span></a></span> together with <span itemprop="colleague" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a itemprop="url" href="http://www.pascal-hitzler.de"><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Pascal</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Hitzler</span></span></a></span>, and be a part of the team developing Wright State's new online <a href="http://cse.wright.edu/currentstudents/program-information/mscybersec">cybersecurity master's program</a>.

If you are a student at Wright State looking for a research topic or GRA position, please check out my research page to get a feel for the type of projects I'm working on. If any of them peak your interest, please send me an email or come by my office in 343 Russ and we can discuss it in more detail. In most cases I encourage students to do an independent study with me (or any prospective academic supervisor) to make sure everything is a good fit before beginning employment as a GRA.

I've had a somewhat winding career path, in that I worked as a civil servant 
at the Air Force Research Lab for quite awhile before going back to school. After seven 
years of government employment, TPS 
reports got the better of me. I quit my cushy government job and tried out 
various other places of employment. Eventually I landed at Wright State 
University, and it has been a great fit. Being an academic is fantastic &mdash; 
I get the opportunity to meet tons of fascinating people and talk about 
interesting ideas with them. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy trying out new craft
beers with my husband <span itemprop="spouse" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Jason</span></span></span> or teaching my dog Shiloh new tricks (like "don't
eat the cat").

I can be reached at <span itemprop="email">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</span>
