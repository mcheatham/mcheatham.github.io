Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Michelle</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Cheatham</span></span>. I currently work as an <span itemprop="jobTitle">Assistant Professor</span> in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at <span itemprop="worksFor" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://www.wright.edu"><span itemprop="name">Wright State University</span></a></span> in <span itemprop="workLocation" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"><a itemprop="url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio"><span itemprop="name">Dayton, Ohio</span></a></span>. My research is on Semantic Web topics as well as topics related to cybersecurity, which I developed expertise in while working for the <a href="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/">Air Force Research Lab</a>. I co-lead the <span itemprop="memberOf" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/daselab.html"><span itemprop="name">Data Semantics (DaSe) Lab</span></a></span> together with <span itemprop="colleague" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a itemprop="url" href="http://www.pascal-hitzler.de"><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Pascal</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Hitzler</span></span></a></span>, which is a part of the <span itemprop="memberOf" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a itemprop="url" href="http://dssc.cs.wright.edu"><span itemprop="name">Data Science and Security Cluster (DSSC)</span></a></span>. I am also part of the team developing Wright State's new online <a href="http://cse.wright.edu/currentstudents/program-information/mscybersec">cybersecurity master's program</a>.

I've had a somewhat winding career path, in that I worked as a civil servant 
at the Air Force Research Lab for quite awhile before going back to school. After seven 
years of government employment, TPS 
reports got the better of me. I quit my cushy government job and tried out 
various other places of employment. Eventually I landed at Wright State 
University, and it has been a great fit. Being an academic is fantastic &mdash; 
I get the opportunity to meet tons of fascinating people and talk about 
interesting ideas with them. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy trying out new craft
beers with my husband <span itemprop="spouse" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Jason</span></span></span> or teaching my dog Shiloh new tricks (like "don't
eat the cat").

I can be reached at <span itemprop="email">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</span>
