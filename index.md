I am currently working towards a PhD in Computer Science at Wright State
University. I've finished the course work and passed the qualifying exam, and I
have decided to focus on confidentiality in wireless sensor networks for my
dissertation. You can check out the research section  to find out how my
dissertation is proceeding.

I am also trying to develop the ability to cook actual edible food. I have
some recipes on here that I enjoy and are fairly resistant to cooking
ineptitude.
